## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Animations
- CSS Transitions
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- DOM

### What I learned

Grid System: The code demonstrates the effective use of CSS Grid to create a responsive layout for the card components. The .card-columns class uses display: grid and grid-template-columns to define a three-column grid, allowing the cards to be arranged in a visually pleasing way.

Flexibility with Flexbox: Within each card, the content is organized using Flexbox. The .card class utilizes display: grid and gap to create a flexible and evenly spaced layout. The Flexbox model is powerful for arranging and aligning elements within containers.

Project Planning and Structure: The HTML structure is well-organized, making use of semantic tags like <main>, <article>, <footer> and <div>. The code shows a clear separation between the main content and the attribution section, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Responsiveness: The code demonstrates a responsive design approach using media queries. By defining different styles for different screen sizes, the layout adapts to varying viewport widths.

In this project I learned how to select elements with Javascript and manipulate them through the events and add text to existing elements from a result.

I used the technique of hiding the second card with the "d-none" class and then switched that class with the first card.

For this project I decided to use radio inputs for ratings to try to make it more responsive.

### Continued development

In the next few codes I intend to explore more concepts of the flex box and the grid. I plan to start deploying animations with CSS as well and write simpler and more straightforward code.
